Answer **at least one** of the following questions (in 5-7 sentences) and be ready to discuss all of them in class. You will **not** receive extra credit for answering more than one question. 

1. What are your thoughts on a citizen score? Would they change if your score could only improve for good actions, and would not be affected by bad? How do you view this system in relation to other commonplace ones, such as credit scores?

2. What role, if any, do you think machine learning and artificial intelligence should have in hiring? Do you believe the government has a responsibility to put restrictions on their usage in that area? How do we keep these algorithms from using private information to make their decisions?
