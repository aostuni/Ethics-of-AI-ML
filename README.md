## Course Description
This discussion-based course will provide an introduction to the ethical issues related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The first half of the semester will focus on concerns existing in the present day, such as bias and transparency. During the semester's second half, we will cover topics that will be increasingly important going forward, from consciousness to the future of labor.

## Class Format
This course will primarily be discussion-based, with the topic of each week's discussion determined by a set of short readings. These readings must be completed before class and used to write a response to a short-answer question. Prior to the class discussion, there may be a brief lecture on a specific idea or concept that could be of value to the conversation. The primary assignments for the class will be two papers.


## Grading
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department [grades server](https://grades.cs.umd.edu/).

You are responsible for all material discussed during lecture, as well as readings and 
other material posted on ELMS or Piazza outside of class.

| Percentage | Title 
|:----:|:----:|
| 10% | Reading Short-Answer  
| 30% | Participation 
| 25% | Midterm Paper
| 35% | Final Paper

### Discussions 
The majority of time in the classroom will be spent in group discussion. This will allow for an efficient exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives, as well as forcing you to become more comfortable organizing and articulating technical and philosophical concepts. We will decide discussion rules together as a class during the first week.

### Papers
There will be two essays that will compose the majority of your work outside the classroom. The first will be assigned after Week 6, and it will be on one of the topics discussed up to that point in class. The final paper will be assigned at the end of the semester, and it should represent the culmination of ideas developed throughout the course. The official assignment details for both papers will be released closer to the assignment dates.

All regrade requests must be made within one week of the assignment grade being released.

### Late Policy
All assignments may be turned in up to 24 hours late with a 20% penalty. 
After 24 hours, no late assignments will be accepted.

## Schedule
The schedule is subject to change; students will be notified in such an
occurrence.

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and
plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
[Office of Student Conduct](http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
