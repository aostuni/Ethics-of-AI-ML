## Class Format
This course will primarily be discussion-based, with the topic of each week's discussion determined by a set of short readings. These readings must be completed before class and used to write a response to a short-answer question. Prior to the class discussion, there may be a brief lecture on a specific idea or concept that may be of value to the discussion. The primary assignments for the class will be papers.

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and
plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
[Office of Student Conduct](http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
