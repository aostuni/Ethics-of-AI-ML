1. What does it mean for AI to be creative? Does it differ from how humans are creative? By your definition, is it possible for AI to ever be truly creative? Justify your answer.

2. After watching “Multi-Agent Hide and Seek,” consider the iterative challenges each side had to face and their eventual solution.
