1. What role, if any, should machine learning and artificial intelligence play in warfare? How do we ensure such weapons do not overstep that role? Is such technology inevitable?

2. If (or when) such weapons came to exist, they would likely strength both a countryâ€™s defensive and offensive capabilities. Which of those two capabilities do you think would benefit more from this technology? How would that discrepancy in strength play out in terms of the likelihood of armed conflict? Justify.
